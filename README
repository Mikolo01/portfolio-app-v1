This is a simple website showcasing my portfolio as a DevOps Engineer. It includes my resume, projects, and contact information. 
The website is built using javascript and HTML running on React App. 
This is for development purpose.
A modified version would be for production purpose and would have key features listed below

Security Features:

Docker Security: Non-root user execution, Minimal Alpine base image, Regular security updates, Restricted privileges

Web Security: Comprehensive security headers, Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTPS ready configuration, Security.txt endpoint

DevSecOps Features: Reproducible builds, Environment variables for configuration, Automated deployment ready



Additional Recommendations: Add SSL/TLS, Set up automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD, Add monitoring/logging integration all of which are included in the V2 of this website
